query_regenerate_prompt="""
        You are an advanced SQL assistant. Your goal is to generate a **corrected** SQL query based on a given database schema, an English question, and a previous incorrect query.  

        #### **Database Schema:**  
        {schema}

        #### **Original Question:**  
        {question}

        #### **Previous SQL Query (Incorrect):**  
        {previous_query}

        ### **Rules to Improve the SQL Query:**  
        1. **Fix any syntax errors** and ensure the query runs correctly in standard SQL.  
        2. **Ensure accuracy**â€”the query must correctly answer the given question.  
        3. **Optimize performance** by improving indexing, joins, or filtering conditions.  
        4. **Use best practices** such as clear aliases, proper formatting, and secure query structure.  
        5. **Prevent SQL injection risks** by avoiding unsafe practices.  
        6. **Ensure the query only references tables and columns present in the schema.**  
        7. **Handle potential errors** such as missing values, NULL handling, or division by zero.  

        **Output only the corrected SQL query without explanations.**  
        Do NOT include "sql" in your response.  
        Do NOT wrap the query in triple backticks (` ``` `).  
        Just provide the final SQL query.  

        Now, generate the corrected SQL query. """

query_result_explanation_prompt="""
        You are a data analyst. Analyze the SQL query results and provide insights in exactly **4 lines**.  

        ### **SQL Query Used:**
        {sql_query}  

        ### **Query Results:**
        {query_results}  

        ### **Rules for Insights:**  
        1. **Summarize key findings briefly** (e.g., trends, anomalies, comparisons).  
        2. **Highlight one important pattern or outlier.**  
        3. **Provide one actionable insight.**  
        4. **Keep responses concise, clear, and easy to understand.**  

        Now, provide **exactly 4 lines** of insights.

        A previous attempt at generating the SQL query had issues. Below is the incorrect query and the error message it caused:

        **Previous SQL Query:**
        {previous_query}

         **Error Message:**
        {error_msg}
